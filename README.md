# Store-Management-System

This project is my first project in the field of Computer Science.
I designed the code of “Store Management System” in asimplest way without using database.
This project contains 480 lines of code.
I use “C++ Programming language” to write this code and the code compiler is “Visual Studio Community 2019”.
